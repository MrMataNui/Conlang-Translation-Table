# Conlang-Translation-Table
This is the place where you can enter in a translation tool for your language.

To enter in your conlang, open the HTML document and go to the <script> tag that contains variables. You would format your dictionary as:
  { EnglishWord: 'ConlangWord', EnglishWord: 'ConlangWord', ...};
and enter that into var dict.

You can do a similar thing with your letters as:
  { Letter: '/IPA/', Letter: '/IPA/', ...};
and enter that into var letters.

For IPA symbols, go to http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-charts/ipa-symbols-with-html-codes/.

For other characters, go to https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref.
